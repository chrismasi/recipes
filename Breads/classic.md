# Classic Bread
## Equipment
- Baking Vessel
  - Dutch Oven
  - Stoneware Baker
  - Baking Stone with a bowl over the top
- Food safe spray bottle full of water
  - You can also carefully pour water, but spray bottle is better
- Bread Lame
  - Or a safety razor blade that you have washed.
## Ingredients
- 3c Flour
- 2t Salt
- 0.25t Active Yeast
- 1.5c Warm Water
## Directions
- In a large bowl, mix flour, salt and yeast.
- Add water and mix until water is absorbed.
- Cover the bowl and let sit for 20 minutes.
- Using a wet hand, do a few stretch and folds to build elasticity/strength in dough.
- Cover the bowl and let rise for 8-10 hours. (About double in size, I usually go a little extra.)
- Shape the loaf
  - Turn dough out onto floured surface.
  - Knead a few times with floured hands, shape into a loaf, place on parchment paper in bowl or on linen in basket
  - Cover and let sit for 30 minutes.
- Place a rack on lowest setting, preheat oven to 450 with dutch oven or stoneware baker.
- Take out dutch oven/stoneware baker and remove lid.
- Place parchment paper with dough inside baking vessel.
- Use a lame or blade to score then spray several times with water so outside of dough is moist.
  - For round loaves, I prefer the "X" in the center.
- Put cover back on and put in oven.
- Bake bread!
  - For hard crust, bake with lid on for 30 minutes, remove cover (and parchment paper) and bake for 20.
  - For soft crust, bake with lid on until internal bread temperature is >=200 degrees Farenheit (about 40 minutes).
## Notes
- Store dough in fridge after shaping loaf.
- Put dough in fridge for 10 minutes before slicing with lame if too soft.
