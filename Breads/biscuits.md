# Biscuits
## Ingredients
- 2c Flour
- 1T Baking Powder
- 1t Salt
- 1/2c Butter or Shortening
- 3/4c Milk
## Directions
- Preheat oven to 450f. Sift flour with baking powder and salt into medium bowl.
- Cut shortening into flour mixture until mixture resembles course cornmeal.
- Make a well in the center. Pour in 3/4c Milk. Stir quickly around the bowl, if mixture seems dry, add more milk to form a dough that is moist enough to leave sides of bowl and form a ball.
- Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface to knead. Gently pick up the dough from the side away from you; fold over toward you; press out lightly with palm of hand. Give dough a quarter turn. Repeat 10 times.
- Gently roll out dough, from center, to 1/2-3/4 inch thickness.
- With floured 2.5 inch biscuit cutter, cut straight down into dough being careful not to twist cutter. Should yield ~12 biscuits.
- Place on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake 10-12 minutes.
## Notes
- Add 3/4c sugar for sweet biscuits (for Strawberry Shortcake!)
