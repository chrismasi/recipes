# French Toast Bagels
## Ingredients
- 4 Tbsp light brown sugar, divided
- 1 package (2¼ tsp) RED STAR Active Dry Yeast
- 1 cup warm water (about 110°F)
- 3½ cups bread flour, plus more for kneading
- 1½ tsp salt
- ¾ tsp cinnamon
- ¼ cup maple syrup
- 1 tsp pure vanilla extract
- 2 eggs, divided
- 2 Tbsp granulated sugar mixed with 1½ tsp cinnamon, for topping
## Directions
- In a small bowl, combine 2 Tbsp brown sugar with yeast.
- Add ½ cup warm water; stir until yeast dissolves.
- Let mixture stand 10 minutes until foamy.
- Add flour, salt, cinnamon and remaining 2 Tbsp brown sugar into mixing bowl and stir with dough hook until combined.
- Add yeast mixture along with ¼ cup warm water, maple syrup, vanilla and 1 egg.
- Stir until a dough forms.
- Knead dough in stand mixer on medium speed 5 minutes, adding just enough of remaining ¼ cup warm water until dough is smooth, elastic and only slightly sticky
- Shape dough into a ball and place in a large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place 1 to 1½ hours until doubled.
- Punch down risen dough; let rest 10 minutes.
- Add 4qt water to large pot. Heat water to just below a simmer. Heat oven to 425°F, and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat.
- Divide dough into 8 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a smooth ball. Use fingers to poke a hole in center of each ball, stretching each hole until it is as big as half the diameter of entire bagel (it might look too big at first, but it will shrink when you boil/bake it). Place bagels on prepared baking sheet. Cover with a damp towel or lightly greased plastic wrap and let rest 10 minutes.
- Once bagels have rested, use a slotted spoon to lower a few bagels at a time into simmering water. Allow bagels to float to top. Leave bagels in water 1 to 2 minutes, then flip over and leave in water another 1 to 2 minutes (the longer they stay in the water, the chewier they become). Remove bagels with slotted spoon and return to prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining bagels.
- Beat remaining egg with 1 Tbsp water, then brush egg wash over tops of bagels. Sprinkle generously with cinnamon sugar.
- Bake 20 to 25 minutes until bagels are golden brown and baked through. Remove from oven and let cool completely on a cooling rack before slicing.
