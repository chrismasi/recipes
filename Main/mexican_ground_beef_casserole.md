#  Recipe Notes:
1. Rice - recipe works best with long grain white rice. Will also work with medium or short white rice grain, "standard" (unspecified) white rice, jasmine* or basmati rice*. Recipe as written won't work with: brown rice, wild rice, risotto, paella rice, quinoa.
2. Corn - can also use frozen, 1 3/4 cups.
3. Cheese - use anything that melts! Cheddar, mozzarella, tasty, Monterey Jack, Colby.
4. Cayenne adds spiciness, this amount across a vast volume of rice is barely noticeable. Increase or eliminate if desired.
5. Leftovers will keep for 3 days in the fridge, reheat in microwave. I haven't tried freezing but I don't see why it wouldn't freeze ok!
6. Nutrition per serving, this is quite a generous serving (about 2 packed cups, and it's dense so very filling!). Every cup of cheese adds 100 calories per serving, so if you want to cut back on calories, halve the cheese (don't skip completely!).
