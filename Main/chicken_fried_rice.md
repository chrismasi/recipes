## Recipe Notes:
Substitute items marked with * with any dice-able, stir-fry-able vegetables of choice!
1. Bacon - adds terrific flavour to fried rice, it's a sub for Chinese sausages and Chinese BBQ Pork which restaurants usually use. Sub with ham. Sounds criminal to trim excess fat if you have really fatty bacon, it will make fried rice taste too bacony!
2. Best rice for fried rice - long grain white rice or other white rice, cooked, then refrigerated overnight or frozen then thawed. Rice should be dry and crumbly, not sticky.
3. Chinese cooking wine or Mirin (or cooking sake or dry sherry) is an essential ingredient for making a truly "restaurant standard" fried rice. Though many recipes suggest using liquid chicken broth, please do not do this - it makes your fried rice wet and gluey! If you can't consume alcohol, adjust recipe as follows: Reduce oyster and soy sauce to 2 tsp each, and add 1 tbsp water to the Sauce. Proceed with recipe. When you add the rice, add 1/2 tsp chicken or vegetable stock powder (or bouillon cube crumbled). Stir through, then add remaining Sauce ingredients exc the Cooking wine. Proceed with recipe, add tiny sprinkle of salt at end if you want it saltier.
4. Oyster sauce can be substituted with either fish sauce + hoisin sauce (best!) or just hoisin sauce (though you will get a slight Chinese Five Spice Flavour which is lovely!)
5. Soy sauce - use light or all purpose soy sauce. Do not use dark, flavour will be too intense. Maggie seasoning would also work but reduce the quantity a bit (itâ€™s saltier!).
6. Storage - leftovers will keep for up to 3 days, reheat in microwave with a sprinkle of water if necessary to moisten it up again! Can also freeze - thaw then reheat.
7. Nutrition per serving, assuming 4 servings (about 1.5 cups per serving, a light meal or generous side!)
