# Pesto Pasta Salad
## Ingredients
- 16oz Box Bowtie Pasta (prepared)
- 8oz Package Grape Tomatos (halved)
- 8oz Package Small Mozzarella Balls (halved)
- 1/4 Red Onion (diced)
- 2 Avocado (diced)
- 2 Grilled Chicken Breast (diced)
- Ripped Up Basil Leaves
- Balsamic Dressing

## Directions
- Mix all of the stuff together, then eat it.

## Notes
- I've made this a bunch of times and we have never really had a recipe so it is slightly different everytime. I wanted to formalize it but this is more of a general guideline. I'll refine it more as time goes on. Probably.
