# Indian Chicken Curry 2
## Ingredients
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 tablespoons curry powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 bay leaf
- 1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root
- 1/2 teaspoon white sugar
- salt to taste
- 2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 cup plain yogurt
- 3/4 cup coconut milk
- 1/2 lemon, juiced
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper

## Directions
- Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.
- Saute onion until lightly browned.
- Stir in garlic, curry powder, cinnamon, paprika, bay leaf, ginger, sugar and salt. Continue stirring for 2 minutes.
- Add chicken pieces, tomato paste, yogurt, and coconut milk.
- Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes.
- Remove bay leaf, and stir in lemon juice and cayenne pepper.
- Simmer 5 more minutes.

## Notes
- I usually add 2 large potatoes cut into 1"x1"x0.5" pieces and about 8oz of baby carrots cut in half. I add those and cook them for maybe 8 minutes before adding the chicken. This makes the recipe less saucy, but you could easily double everything except the chicken to fix that.
