# Chicken Pot Pie with Biscuit Topping
## Ingredients
### Biscuits
- 4 cups biscuit flour, plus more for dusting
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 cup unsalted butter, 2 sticks, cubed, very cold
- 1 cup buttermilk
### Filling
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 3 cups milk
- 1 rotisserie chicken, shredded
- 1 ½ cups frozen pea and carrot
- ½ cup frozen pearl onion
- 1 cup small potato, diced
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 2 teaspoons black pepper
## Directions
- Make the biscuits: In a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
- Using your a fork, your hands, or a pastry cutter, work the butter into the dry ingredients, leaving pea-sized chunks.
- Add the buttermilk and fold with a rubber spatula until a thick dough comes together.
- Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Bring the dough together into one large mass, then roll out with a rolling pin to about 1 ½-2 inches (4-5 centimeters) thick.
- Using a 2-3-inch (5-7 centimeter) biscuit cutter or small glass dipped in flour, cut out rounds from the dough. Cut out all of the rounds, then place on top of the filling so the dough does not warm too much. Re-roll the dough scraps if needed. You should have about 10 biscuits total.
- Put biscuits into fridge while preparing Filling.
- Preheat the oven to 375ºF (190ºC).
- Make the filling: Melt the butter in a large cast-iron skillet (12") over medium-high heat. Add the the flour and whisk until bubbling.
- Whisk in the milk until smooth, then continue to cook until the filling is bubbling and the liquid has thickened slightly, 7-10 minutes.
- Add the chicken, peas and carrots, pearl onions, potato, salt, and pepper. Stir until everything is well coated Remove the pan from the heat.
- Place pan in oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, until the biscuits are golden brown and cooked through. Carefully remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes. Garnish with chives before serving.
## Notes
- You can use regular milk instead of Buttermilk for biscuits, it's not a showstopper (I look forward to your angry letters).
- You can use 2c of mixed frozen vegetables instead of peas, carrots and onions.
- Microwave potatoes for 3-4 minutes before dicing to make sure they are cooked through.
- You can put egg wash, cheese, etc on biscuits if you would like. I don't...
- I 1.5-2x biscuit recipe to make sure I have enough to top pie and bonus biscuits can be cooked next to it and are always appreciated.
