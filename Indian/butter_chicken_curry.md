# Slow Cooker Butter Chicken Curry
## Ingredients
- 1 Diced Large Onion
- 3 Crushed Garlic Cloves
- 4 Boneless Chicken Thighs
- 2 Tablespoons Tomato Paste
- 1 teaspoon Garam Masala
- 1/2 teaspoon Ground Coriander
- Chilli Pepper Powder (to personal taste)
- Chicken Stock / Water (just enough to cover chicken)
- 2 Tablespoons Butter
- 2 Tablespoons Heavy Cream
- Salt (to personal taste)
## Directions
- Heat a pan on a medium-high heat then fry the diced onions in some oil until they start to turn golden brown.
- Once slightly browned, add the crushed garlic, the Garam Masala and the Ground Coriander, and continue to fry and stir for one minute. Transfer to a Crockpot once done.
- Wash the chicken thighs and place on top of the onions in the crock pot. Add some Chicken Stock (or Water) until it's just covering the chicken.
- Add in the tomato paste and butter. The butter can be put in cold, just make sure to give it a stir once melted within the first hour.
